Hi, I’m Nayan Malviya

I’m passionate about backend development and building scalable web applications using Java, Spring Boot, and modern web technologies.
I have a strong foundation in Core Java, OOP, and DSA, and I’m currently expanding my skills in Spring Boot, Hibernate, RESTful APIs, and React.

Skills:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Bootstrap
Backend: Java, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Hibernate
Database: MySQL

I am open to collaborating on backend-heavy projects, microservices, and API-driven systems, as well as full-stack applications that solve real-world problems.
