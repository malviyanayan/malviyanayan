- 👋 Hi, I’m Nayan Malviya
- 👀 I’m interested in developing Java applications for web browsers.
- 🌱 I have completed Core Java and am currently learning Advanced Java, JSP, and React. I’m also working with JavaScript, MySQL, and Bootstrap to build dynamic, responsive applications.
- 💼 I’m skilled in full-stack web development, including frontend design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as backend programming using servlets, JSP, and JDBC.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborating on projects in both frontend and backend development, particularly those that involve Java and web-based technologies.
